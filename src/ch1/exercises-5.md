### Exercises

#### Exercise 1.14

Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the ``count-change/1`` function of the section [Tree Recursion]() in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases? 

#### Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $$sin\ x \approx x$$ if $$x$$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity 

$$
sin \ r = 3 sin \frac{r}{3} - 4 sin^3 \frac{r}{3}
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $$sin$$. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following functions:

```lisp
(defun cube (x) (* x x x))

(defun p (x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(defun sine (angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a.  How many times is the function ``p/1`` called when ``(sine 12.15)`` is evaluated?

b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of ``a``) used by the process generated by the ``sine/1`` function when ``(sine a)`` is evaluated?
