### Exercises

#### Exercise 1.6

Bob Bitwright doesn't see why ``if`` needs to be provided as a special form. "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary function in terms of ``cond``?" he asks. Bob's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of ``if``:

```lisp
(defun new-if (predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        ('true else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Bob:

```lisp
> (new-if (== 2 3) 0 5)
5
> (new-if (== 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Bob uses ``new-if/3`` to rewrite the square-root program:

```lisp
(defun sqrt (guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

#### Exercise 1.7.

The ``good-enough?/2`` test used in computing square roots will not be very
effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real
computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited
precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these
statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large
numbers. An alternative strategy for implementing ``good-enough?/2`` is to
watch how ``guess`` changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the
change is a very small fraction of the guess. Design a square-root function
that uses this kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large
numbers?

#### Exercise 1.8.

Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if \\(y\\) is an
approximation to the cube root of \\(x\\), then a better approximation is given
by the value

\\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\frac{x}{y^2}+2y}
{3}
\end{align}
\\]

Use this formula to implement a cube-root function analogous to the square-root
function. (In the section [Functions as Returned Values]() we will see how to
implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and
cube-root functions.)
